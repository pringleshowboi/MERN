# MERN Stack Overview

The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies for building full-stack web applications using JavaScript.

## Components

### 1. MongoDB
A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

### 2. Express.js
Back-end
A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js, used to build backend APIs.
A web-freamework is a ready-to-use toolbox for building web apps faster and more easily

### 3. React.js
Front-end
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications.

### 4. Node.js
A JavaScript runtime environment that executes server-side code.

## Benefits

- Full-stack JavaScript development
- High performance and scalability
- Large community support

## Typical Architecture

1. **Frontend:** React.js
2. **Backend:** Express.js with Node.js
3. **Database:** MongoDB

## Getting Started

1. Set up MongoDB database.
2. Build backend API with Express.js and Node.js.
